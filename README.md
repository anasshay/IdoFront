# IdoFront
### Set up the backend server first!
#### Clone the repository
#### cd to IdoFront directory
#### run the command `yarn` and wait for the installation
#### run the command `yarn start` to run the application

### Notes about the application
- I used React with Styled Component library for the frontend design.
- The Login functionality is still not implemented correctly, it's functional, but in the frontend.
- Adding a new card will insert it at the bottom of the "Todo" list.
- You can search by card title.
- The user logo is still a placeholder and not a dynamic one yet.
